//		✧ Overview of Java******************************************************************
		
//		java is a general purpose, class based, object oriented programming language, 
//		it is among the most used programming language.
//		also used as computing platform, consoles, enterprise softwares, datacenters, android
		
		
		
		
		
		
//		✧ Setting up [JDK, JRE, IDE]******************************************************
		//JUST DOWNLOAD ECLIPSE AND JAVA JDK
		
		
		
		
		
//		✧ Basic Syntax and Structure************************************************************
		
		//class Main{
		//public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//}
		//}
		
		//For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which 
		//must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
//		✧ Primitive Data Types*********************************************************
		
		//Boolean, 
		//char, 
		//byte, 
		//int, 
		//short, 
		//long, 
		//float, and 
		//double
		
		
		
//		✧ Variables and Constants***************************************************
		
//		String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
//		int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
//		float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
//		char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
//		boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
		
		
//		int myNum = 5;
//		float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
//		char myLetter = 'D';
//		boolean myBool = true;
//		String myText = "Hello";
		
		
		
		
//		The general rules for naming variables are:
//
//			Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
//			Names must begin with a letter
//			Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
//			Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
//			Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
//			Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
		
		
//	Data types are divided into two groups:
//
//		Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
//		Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes 
		
		
		
//		The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
//
//			- Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types 
//			are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
//			- Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, 
//			while primitive types cannot.
//			- A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
//			- A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts 
//			with an uppercase letter.
		
		
		
		
//		Java Type Casting
//		Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
//
//		In Java, there are two types of casting:
//
//		Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
//		byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
//
//		Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
//		double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

		
		
//		✧ Operators*****************************************************************
		
		//Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
		
//		Java divides the operators into the following groups:
//
//			Arithmetic operators  => +
//			Assignment operators  => =
//			Comparison operators  => ==
//			Logical operators     => ||
//			Bitwise operators     =>  ^
